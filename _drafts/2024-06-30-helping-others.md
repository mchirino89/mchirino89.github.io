> Every problem is a Human problem
Unknown

We human are great at solving abstract problems. Every child with basic literacy knows how to do 2 digit sum. 15 + 32 = 47. It's math, it's non-ambiguos and universal everywhere in the universe. It's when we talk about large scale endevours that involve a mix of disciplines when things get interesting and often times messy. It all starts with communication (or the lack thereof)

## Background context

What I'm about to tell is a story with no heroes nor villans. Simply a couple of well intention engineers who got carried away.

Let's call the first engineer Peter and the second one Josh. 

Peter is 9 - 5 focused guy who does 95% of the time what he's required and no more. He likes his job but he understands its a job, there's life before and there's life it. However, there's this 5% left when he faces a situation when it's too obvious the simplest, quickest solution simply doesn't cut it and reach out for some extra context to do the _right_ thing.

Josh is the _extra mile_ kind of engineer. He's always on the look out for leverage to boost productivity, both for himself as well as for others. He is the maverick kind when it comes to scalability causes. More than once has he worked overhours in pursue of some approach that in the long run makes life easier to the engineering team.

Peter and Josh have been working in the same company for a couple of years now and even though we can see how their personalities can (and did) collide, they get along. Josh has a very good memory and believes he can increase the 5% of drive, specially due to the fact that a couple of occasions in the past Peter has reduced tech debt Josh's team had created.

## Story time

Fastforward to present time, Peter reached out to Josh for some help. He was wondering if he could reuse some of the Josh's team UI in his flows. Josh of course was more than delight to offer assistance in this for several reasons

- No only did this presented as a chance to repay some of previous tech debt favors done by Peter in the past but it also allowed to foster that 5% of extra mile mindset in Peter.

- Reusing existent code (specially UI) is one of the things why Josh spends so much of his time and energy un scalability tasks in the project
 
- This was a chance to proove management the ROI on tech debt and scalability pays off

It was a golden opportunity from every vantage point; or so Johs thought...

## Execution

By the time Peter made the assistance request, Josh was in the middle of a project for his team with deadline as usual. However, Josh made the judgement call to set it aside and worked on setting the stage for his collegue. He though the reasons above exposed would only be valid if Peter deadline was met. Otherwise this would become in yet another tech debt item for "later improvement" (later = never)
