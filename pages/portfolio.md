## üì± MatchWords

My most recent side project. 2022 was all about MatchWords coding during my free time. The game's mechanic is as simple as it comes: form as many words as possible before the time runs up, dragging your finger around in ANY and ALL directions.

## üì± MyStickers

This is probably the first idea of an app I ever developed for publication back in 2014. The premise is simple: instead of losing paper lists with your missing sticker numbers from an album your completing (may that be for the [latest soccer cup tournament][soccer], an [Avenger's movie][avengers], etc), choose to use _MyStickers_ for such task. It allows for quick sorting and searching as well as sharing the list with other users via QR code.
