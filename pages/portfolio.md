## üì± MatchWord

My most recent side project, 2022 is been all MatchWord coding during free time for me. The game mechanics is a simple as they come: form as many words as possible before the time runs up, dragging your finger aroun in ANY and ALL directions.

## üì± MyStickers

This is probably the first idea of an app I ever developed for publication back in 2014. The premise is simple: instead of keep losing paper lists with your missing sticker numbers from an album your completing (may that be for the [latest soccer cup tournament][soccer], an [Avenger's movie][avengers], etc), choose to use _MyStickers_ for such task. It allows for quick sorting and searching as well as sharing the list with other users via QR code.

## üì± Rick and Morty

This one is my most recent experiment/hobby project and I chose a basic API for implementing it such as [Rick and Morty's wiki][wikis]. While it's far from my most visually appealing job, I think it shines on the technical side of things:

- I built it following TDD for the [networking layer][network]
- It's UI is [entirely UIKit programmatic][spmUI] 
- It follows SOLID principles, specially Single responsibility via dependency injection (leveraged by SPM)
- It features dark mode and full accessibility support ([dynamic fonts][dynamic]) on all its text
- The repo is setup with a basic flow for continues integration via [Github actions][ci]

## üíªüñ•üì± Geeking with Mauri

This blog itself is a sample of my work. While young -I started it in mid 2020-, it shows snippets of my day to day workflow as well as some of the reading and learnings I've picked along the way.

It's simple yet functional: responsive and lightweight as well as both dark/light mode friendly üòÑ
