title: Who's behind?

{%- include profile/avatar.html -%}

I've been writing code since 2007 and getting paid for it since 2013 (outside of college), 
a bit over a year since getting my BS in software engineering from [UNET](http://www.unet.edu.ve/).

I felt in love with mobile development, primarily because of the app's fad back then. Now, 
more than a decade since smart phones made their way into out every day lives it's not a trend
anymore: it's the standard. If you don't have a digital mobile presence, a.k.a. a site/app that looks
well and performs properly on a mobile device then you (or the team behind your business/company) is doing
something wrong.

Beyond that, I like reading ([A LOT](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95758480-mauricio-chirino)), 
also collaborate and [give back](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2376336/mauricio-chirino) 
to the community when time and family obligations allow me to. Feel free to 
[reach me out](https://github.com/mchirino89) or leave some [comment](https://twitter.com/Chirino89M). If it's a business/idea topic you can also [find me around](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauriciochirino/)
with a more serious face üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I'm a big believer of crypto power and that lead me to work on [Bitso](https://bitso.com), one of the most valuable fintechs in Latin America.
