I've been writing code since 2007 and getting paid for it since 2013 (outside of college), 
a bit over a year since getting my BS in software engineering from UNET.

I felt in love with mobile development, primarily because of the app's fad back then. Now, 
more than a decade since smart phones made their way into out every day lives it's not a trend
anymore: it's the standard. If you don't have a digital mobile presence, a.k.a. a site/app that looks
well and performs on a mobile device then you (or the team behind your business/company) is doing
something wrong.

Beyond that, I like reading ([A LOT](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/95758480-mauricio-chirino)), 
also collaborate and [give back](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2376336/mauricio-chirino) 
to the community when time and family obligation allows me to. Feel free to 
[reach me out](https://github.com/mchirino89) or leave some [comment](https://twitter.com/Chirino89M)
comment. If it's a business/idea topic you can also [find me around](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauriciochirino/)

Right now I'm working on [PedidosYa](https://www.pedidosya.com/). For those of you reading from USA,
it's like [_DoorDash_](https://www.doordash.com/en-US) but in Latin America -it's not a claim bold 
on my behalf: I knew theirs [Mobile technical lead in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurodriguez7/) a conference and those were her exact 
same words üòÑ-
