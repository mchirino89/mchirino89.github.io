Let's put some context for such a click-bait, eye-catching title I choose for this post. as I said in
[my introduction]({% link about.md %}), I work in the a last mile delivery logistic business and
if you've been following the news _at all_ you do the math:

Delivery service + COVID-19 = developers are swamp at work right now ðŸ˜°

So, how can we manage all the buzz, interruptions and life's context in general and still get things
done? I'll share some of the habits I follow in order to achieve it.

## #1: Limits and boundaries 
Here I refer to set boundaries on your schedule (and even you home space). Just because you have 
your working machine available at all times doesn't mean you should be _able_ to work at anytime.
Set working hours just as you would being at your office. 

Be flexible enough to allow yourself running errands and attending other responsibilities beside 
work. I don't have kids of my own but I'm a husband and a son, therefore I still devote time to 
spend quality waking hours with my family. So should you, a job is only a job and you're just a
number for a company therefore you must not be thinking about work every hour outside of it. Trust 
me, your health and those around you will suffer from it.

## #2: Interruptions = start over
Avoid meetings as much as possible and make blocks of time entirely devoted to a single task

## Context switching
Following the above topic, stay focus on a single topic

## #3: Flow
Be ruthless with the things that distract you: email, YouTube, social networks, your phone on airplane 
mode during Pomodoros. Game and movies soundtracks help me a lot, white noise should do the trick
as well

## #4: Communication
Chances are you're working from home so you need to establish some ground rules with those 
around you in order to avoid unnecessary arguments and discussions on daily basis. Whenever you're
on your working hours you're not another available member of the house (unless an emergency occurs)
therefore you MUST set the ground rules for this with whomever you live with.

## #5: Exercise
